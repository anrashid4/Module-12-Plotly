# Module-12-Plotly

In this module, Roza had us generate a bubble chart along with a scale for Srub Frequency. We were able to create a webpage in which the user can put which ever Test subject they like and get demographic information for that specific subject. Along with the demographic information, we can also display a chart showing the frequency of scrubs.
